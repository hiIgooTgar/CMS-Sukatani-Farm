## Content Management System
<h2>Name Database : wp_lks_cms</h2>
<h3>For administration tasks, we need two user profiles, Admin and Editor :</h3>
<h4>The Admin user - access to the complete WordPress main dashboard.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Username: admin24</li>
	<li>Password: 24admin#</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Editor user - access as editor role in the CMS.</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Username: : editor24</li>
	<li>Password: : 24editor#</li>
